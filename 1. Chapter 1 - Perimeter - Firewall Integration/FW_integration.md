### Overview

The traditional security solutions like firewalls often lack native awareness of Kubernetes workloads. They were not originally designed to comprehend or manage the dynamic and diverse nature of containerized environments.

Calico addresses this limitation by integrating seamlessly with traditional security solutions like Fortinet and AWS Security Groups. This integration provides a sophisticated and fine-grained control mechanism that allows for enhanced security and management capabilities.

With Calico integrated into Fortinet and AWS Security Groups, it becomes possible to exert precise control over access to AWS resources. Additionally, this integration enables Fortinet to gain visibility into Kubernetes workloads. As a result, Fortinet becomes capable of managing the egress traffic from individual workloads, granting greater control and oversight.

One of the notable advantages is the ability to create and enforce Calico Security Policies directly through the Fortimanager interface. This streamlined approach simplifies policy creation and management, offering an intuitive interface for defining and implementing security policies across the Kubernetes environment.
